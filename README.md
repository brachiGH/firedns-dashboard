## **Prerequisite Knowledge**

To follow this course effectively, you should have a basic understanding of:

- **React**: Components, props, state, hooks, Server Components, and Suspense.

If you're new to React, we recommend starting with our **React Foundations** course.

## **System Requirements**

Ensure your system meets the following requirements before starting:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.18.0 or later ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).
- **Operating Systems**: macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Install Dependencies**
This project uses `pnpm` for dependency management. If you donâ€™t have `pnpm` installed, run: 

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**
This project requires environment variables to be configured for the database connection. 

1. Open the `.env.example` file located in the root directory.
2. Set the following variables with your desired values:
   ```env
   POSTGRES_USER=
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
   POSTGRES_HOST=
   POSTGRES_PORT=
   POSTGRES_DATABASE=
    ```
If you're unsure, you can use the default values in the file. 3. Rename .env.example to .env.

Additionally, ensure the database configuration in database/docker-compose.yml matches your .env values. Alternatively, use the default values and simply rename .env.example to .env.

### **3. Set Up the Database**

The project uses a Postgres database, managed through Docker Compose. Navigate to the database folder and launch the database using:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### **4. Launch the Project**

To start the development server, return to the project root directory and run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
This will start the application at http://localhost:3000.
